Due to UT Dallas classes moving to an online format for the last 1/3 of the Spring 2020 semester:

* I started recording the lectures
* I switched the in person mix of slides + whiteboard to a slides only format for this set of online lectures
* The quality of presentation improves as the lecture number increases
* However, this is a still very much a work in progress and a step down in smoothness relative to the live class

Recordings include:

* 081 Vision 1/3
* 082 Vision 2/3
* 083 Vision 3/3
* 091 Language 1/3
* 092 Language 2/3
* 093 Language 3/3
* 101 Speech 1/2
* 102 Speech 2/2
* 111 Games 1/3
* 112 Games 2/3
* 113 Games 3/3
